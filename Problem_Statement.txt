If the request passes the field validation, 200 response will returned.

If the request failed the validation, we need to return 400 http response with proper error message, some sample messages as below:
when account_number not given: "'account_number' is required"
account_number length error: "Length of account_number should be between 7 and 11 when bank_country_code is 'US'"
wrong swift code: "The swift code is not valid for the given bank country code: US"
swift code length error: "Length of 'swift_code' should be either 8 or 11"
